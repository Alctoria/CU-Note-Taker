CU-Note-Taker

## Description

Note-Taker is a back-end project that utilizes node.js and an API.js (js code that I created) for the note-taking application deployed in render to do all functions of CRUD! (Yes, even delete for that extra credit)

There is A LOT of simplification that could have been done, but I followed the CU-module examples to create individual routes for the html pages, and created an server-wide js function that lists all app functions.

## User Story

AS A small business owner,

I WANT to be able to write and save notes,
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a note-taking application,

WHEN I open the Note Taker,
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page,
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text,
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.

WHEN I click on the Save button,
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column,
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.

WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page,
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
